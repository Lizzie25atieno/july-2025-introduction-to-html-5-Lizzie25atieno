    <h1>HTML5 + Accessibility & SEO Basics</h1>

    <p>This web page demonstrates the use of HTML5 semantic tags for clear structure, accessibility features to support inclusive browsing experiences, and basic SEO practices to improve visibility and discoverability in search engines. It prioritizes content that is easy to understand for both users and machines.</p>

        <h3>HTML(HyperText Markup Language)</h3>
        <p>HTML is the basic building block of all websites. Think of it like the structure of a house, it tells the computer what each part of a webpage is supposed to be. Using HTML, we can create things like headings, paragraphs, links, images, and more. It's not a programming language, but a way to mark up content so that the browser knows how to show it. It organizes content in a way that both people and machines (like Google or screen readers) can understand. Without HTML, the internet would just be a pile of text with no order or meaning.</p>
        <h3>Accessibility & SEO Basics</h3>
        <P>Accessibility means making sure that everyone, including people with disabilities, can use and understand your website. For example, some people can't see, hear, or use a mouse. So websites need to be designed in a way that still works for them. That could include using clear labels, providing text for images, and making sure the website can be read using a keyboard or a screen reader. A good website should be easy for everyone to use, no matter how they access it.</P>
